# FamilyPhotoArchive
gallery of family trees 
like a "social media" but only for family members, with some sort of invite link or code; anyone from the family can insert photos, add a caption or timeline to not forget family
and honor the family tree and how we connect. simple comments, emojis, and maybe a "Hall of Fame" for remarkable achievments of said family... also ties to any personal business
to promote each other... 
thanks for reading ... . . .. .
